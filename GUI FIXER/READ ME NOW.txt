if the gui is not showing up unless you have your vr connected,
you need the BepInEx.cfg file to make it work without your vr.

so take the file and put them in your, BepInEx config folder
so go to your gorilla tag game folder, then go to the BepInEx folder
then go to "config" and delete the "BepInEx.cg" file that is already in there
then drop in the new one and open your game

you know you have done it right when a black screen pops up
when you launch the game

Hope this helps :3
